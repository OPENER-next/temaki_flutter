# Example

Flutter example showing the entire Temaki icon set.

## Usage

**Note:** This example displays all icons available in the package. Since iterating over the `TemakiIcons` class members is not possible, this example uses the [reflectable](https://pub.dev/packages/reflectable) package to do so.

Therefore you have to generate the `main.reflectable.dart` file before you run this example. Simply Execute the following command from the `example` directory:
```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
